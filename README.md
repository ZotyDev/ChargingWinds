A Minecraft Spigot plugin for 1.21 that lets you customize the Wind Charge projectile, more specifically:
- Projectile speed
- Explosion power.
- What particle to spawn.
- How many particles to spawn.

> [!NOTE]
> The implementation is not 100% exact, since I could not find a way to replicate certain behaviors.

> [!CAUTION]
> I do not recommend this plugin to be used on an important server, I just created it for a 5-day task, so I cannot guarantee it will be maintained.
